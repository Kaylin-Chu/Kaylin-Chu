### [reimagined-travel](https://github.com/Kaylin-Chu/reimagined-travel)
A user friendly and engaging quiz for finding out where you should holiday. The app gives AI recommendations, perfect for a broke student weekend getaway or a lavish month long honeymoon.
Built with Typescript, it features it features React for the frontend, Express for the backend, and Vite for rapid development. Eventually, this project will incorporate a database of previous recommendations and give accomodation and activity reccomendations when prompted.
### [Invest-or-Repay](https://github.com/Kaylin-Chu/Invest-Or-Repay)
This is where I plan to code a calculator where the user plugs in data (numbers) to find out if they should invest or repay debt based on interest rates, loan terms and the current market.
It will be built with Typescript, I'm building this calculator because I want it to solve my own questions around whether I should be investing more or paying off my mortgage.
### [pokemon-arcade](https://github.com/hotoke-2025/pokemon-arcade)
Pokemon Arcade is a game platform I developed with a talented team. It creates a fun atmosphere where users can fight pokemon, guess pokemon or play tic-tac-toe with unown (Pokemon 201). We built this app using React, Tailwind CSS, Express, and The Pokemon API. This project showcases my collaborative skills and ability to build full-stack applications under tight deadlines.
# Previous projects
### [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Kaylin-Chu/tic-tac-toe)
A 2-player classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with JavaScript. This was one of my first projects and highlights my early interest in game development and commitment to learning through hands-on experience.
### [Shopping-List-Full-Stack](https://github.com/Kaylin-Chu/Shopping-List-Full-Stack)
A fullâ€‘stack web app built with Node, Express, Knex, and React (with React Query) that enables users to maintain a 'shopping list'. The back end includes database migrations, seeds, and RESTful API routes. The front end demonstrates data fetching and mutation. It was a project to enhance learning by structuring a full stack app end to end.
